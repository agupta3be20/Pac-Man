# Pac-Man
Pacman is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1980 by Namco (now known as Bandai Namco Entertainment). It was created by Toru Iwatani, a Japanese video game designer. The game quickly became a huge success and is considered one of the most iconic and influential video games in history.

The game Pacman is simple: the player controls the main character, a small, circular creature called Pacman, and guides it through a maze filled with pellets and various enemies. The goal is to eat all the pellets while avoiding the enemies, which are colorful ghosts named Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange).

The game's maze typically consists of various interconnected pathways, with corners and intersections. Pacman moves through these pathways and can turn at any intersection. The player controls Pacman using arrow keys directing it up, down, left, or right.
